# Assignment 3b
  I've used VScode for all the question created .py file for each questions. All codes were working fine. Please Check if something doesn't work.

## Question 1
  Make sure to provide `org.json` file as input in same folder as program.
  Please enter the Number of Employees in range 3-5 and Employee id in range 001-999. if there isn't any leader b/w the IDs `Leader Not Found` will be printed.
## Question 2
  Make sure to provide `date_calculator.txt` file as input in same folder as program.
  Please enter the dateformat (for ex: dd/mm/yyyy or mm-dd-yyy) in command line. 
## Question 3
  Make sure to put all and only inputtext files in a folder name `inputfiles`,and also in same directory as q3.py.
  I've made many changes from the Q3a code. But the logic is still the same which is AND of FreeSlots (available in 0s and 1s). 
  Made code more readable. 2D list were used unlike the part a.
  AvailableSlots contains non-busy time slots of all the employees.
  FreeSlots is same as AvailableSlots but in 0s and 1s. where 0 represents busy and 1 free or empty.
